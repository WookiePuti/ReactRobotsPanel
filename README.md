This project is intended to include the newest web technologies.

The core of the app is a simple React page, which uses RoboHash API in order to render some cards of robots, which could simulate for example showing web app users info.

Project includes several branches, which improved the basic core with some additional, modern features.

Improvements:

- Usage of React hooks and Redux in order to manage app state for example a fetch state
- Usage of PWA techniques for example the service workers which take care about caching
- Usage of static typing with the TypeScript and TSX in order to adapt project to the newest trends

I am also working at creating some tests with Jest and snapshot testing
